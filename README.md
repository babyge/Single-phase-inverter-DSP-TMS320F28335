Paper: "A Reactive Power Compensation Method for a Smart Grid Connected Inverter Using a Residential PV System"

Abstract

This work explores reactive power compensation on a small photovoltaic generation at residential installation to enhance reliability on a Smart Grid. In order to accomplish this goal, the modulator values of the inverter are determined to obtain the allowable range of reactive power compensation in a photovoltaic system connected to the grid trough out a single-phase voltage source inverter. Mathematical validation in addition to simulations and experimental results are included to validate the proposed approach. Although the method is used in small generation systems, it can be extended to large power systems.
